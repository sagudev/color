# Changelog

The latest published Color release is [0.3.2](#032-2025-09-10) which was released on 2025-09-10.
You can find its changes [documented below](#032-2025-09-10).

## [Unreleased][]

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.82.

### Added

* Add `lerp_rect_unpremultiplied` to interpolate `AlphaColor` without premultiplying alpha (in unpremultiplied "straight" alpha space). ([#199][] by [@tomcur][])

## [0.3.2][] (2025-09-10)

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.82.

### Added

* Add `interpolate_unpremultiplied` and `gradient_unpremultiplied` for interpolating in unpremultiplied (straight) alpha space.

  While such interpolation will often give perceptually undesired results, this allows using Color to implement rendering features where such interpolation is specified, like in the [HTML Canvas element][]. ([#185][] by [@sagudev][])

### Changed

* Specify XYZ-D65 color space conversion matrices as exact rationals. ([#171][] by [@tomcur][])
* Improve documentation of `AlphaColor` vs `PremulColor` to clarify alpha premultiplication, and make both types more discoverable from each other. ([#190][] by [@tomcur][])

[HTML Canvas element]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/commit-snapshots/a93c6fa9fa95e31f1caa05f2f8abc650669df7c3/#interpolation

## [0.3.1][] (2025-05-19)

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.82.

### Fixed

* Compilation failure with nightly Rust due to `core_float_math` changes. ([#175][] by [@ajakubowicz-canva][])

## [0.3.0][] (2025-04-30)

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.82.

### Added

* Support converting between color spaces without chromatic adaptation, thereby representing the same absolute color in the destination color space as in the source color space. ([#139][], [#153][] by [@tomcur][])
  * Add absolute color conversion matrices for ProPhoto RGB, ACES2065-1 and ACEScg for faster conversion without chromatic adaptation to and from these color spaces. ([#156][], [#164][], [#165][] by [@tomcur][])

  **Note to `ColorSpace` implementers:** the `WHITE_POINT` associated constant is added to `ColorSpace`, defaulting to D65.
  Implementations with a non-D65 white point should set this constant to get correct default absolute conversion behavior.
* Support manual chromatic adaptation of colors between arbitrary white point chromaticities.  ([#139][] by [@tomcur][])
* Add `Missing::EMPTY` to allow getting an empty `Missing` set in `const` contexts. ([#149][] by [@tomcur][])
* Add `From<AlphaColor<_>> for DynamicColor` conversions for all color spaces that have a direct runtime representation in `ColorSpaceTag`. ([#155][] by [@LaurenzV][])
* Add usage examples for `DynamicColor::interpolate` and `gradient`. ([#158][], [#159][] by [@tomcur][])

### Changed

* Breaking change: the deprecated conversion `From<Rgba8> for PremulColor<Srgb>` has been removed. Use `From<PremulRgba8> for PremulColor<Srgb>` instead. ([#157][] by [@tomcur][])
* Improve `no_std` support. ([#146][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
* Make `{AlphaColor, OpaqueColor, PremulColor}::to_rgba8` faster. ([#166][] by [@tomcur][])

### Fixed

* Correctly determine analogous components between ACES2065-1 and other color spaces when converting,
  to carry missing components forward when interpolating colors with missing components in the ACES 2065-1 colorspace. ([#144][] by [@tomcur][])
* Fixed powerless hue component calculation for the HWB color space. ([#145][] by [@tomcur][])

## [0.2.4][] (2025-05-19)

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.82.

### Fixed

* Compilation failure with nightly Rust due to `core_float_math` changes. ([#175][] by [@ajakubowicz-canva][])

## [0.2.3][] (2025-01-20)

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.82.

### Added

* Support for the ACES2065-1 color space. ([#124][] by [@tomcur][])
* A documentation example implementing `ColorSpace`. ([#130][] by [@tomcur][])
* Conversions of `[u8; 4]` and packed `u32` into `Rgba8` and `PremulRgba8` are now provided. ([#135][] by [@tomcur][])
* Support construction of `AlphaColor<Srgb>`, `OpaqueColor<Srgb>` and `PremulColor<Srgb>` from rgb8 values. ([#136][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])

### Fixed

* Specify some `ColorSpace::WHITE_COMPONENTS` to higher precision. ([#128][], [#129][] by [@tomcur][])

## [0.2.2][] (2025-01-03)

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.82.

### Fixed

* Colors in `XyzD65` are serialized as `xyz-d65` rather than `xyz`. ([#118][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
* Alpha values are clamped at parse time. ([#119][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])

## [0.2.1][] (2024-12-27)

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.82.

### Added

* Add `FromStr` impl for `AlphaColor`, `DynamicColor`, `OpaqueColor`, `PremulColor`. ([#111][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])

### Changed

* Don't enable `serde`'s `std` feature when enabling our `std` feature. ([#108][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
* `From<Rgba8>` for `PremulColor` is deprecated and replaced by `From<PremulRgba8>`. ([#113][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])

### Fixed

* Make color parsing case insensitive. ([#109][] by [@raphlinus][])

## [0.2.0][] (2024-12-17)

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.82.

### Added

* Add `BLACK`, `WHITE`, and `TRANSPARENT` constants to the color types. ([#64][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
* The `serde` feature enables using `serde` with `AlphaColor`, `DynamicColor`, `HueDirection`, `OpaqueColor`, `PremulColor`, and `Rgba8`. ([#61][], [#70][], [#80][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
* Conversion of a `Rgba8` to a `u32` is now provided. ([#66][], [#77][] by [@waywardmonkeys][], [#100][] by [@tomcur][])
* A new `PremulRgba8` type mirrors `Rgba8`, but for `PremulColor`. ([#66][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
* `AlphaColor::with_alpha` allows setting the alpha channel. ([#67][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
* Support for the `ACEScg` color space. ([#54][] by [@MightyBurger][])
* `DynamicColor` gets `with_alpha` and `multiply_alpha`. ([#71][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
* `DynamicColor` now impls `PartialEq`. ([#75][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
* `AlphaColor`, `OpaqueColor`, and `PremulColor` now impl `PartialEq`. ([#76][], [#86][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
* `HueDirection` now impls `PartialEq`. ([#79][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
* `ColorSpaceTag` and `HueDirection` now have bytemuck support. ([#81][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
* A `DynamicColor` parsed from a named color or named color space function now serializes back to that name, as per the CSS Color Level 4 spec ([#39][] by [@tomcur][]).
* `CacheKey` to allow using colors as keys for resource caching. ([#92][] by [@DJMcNab][])

### Changed

* The `mul_alpha` method was renamed to `multiply_alpha`. ([#65][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])

### Fixed

* Stray parenthesis in hex serialization of `Rgba8` fixed. ([#78][] by [@raphlinus][])
